Cera Care React Challenge

State managment = zustand --> https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand - first time implementing it and its very simple and easy to understand.

I used plain css to style my components - but i could have used any libraries of choice lime MUI or Bootstrap, i chose to use plain CSS to keep things simple

I did not manage to add overlay to gray out the background and when tried to add it to the project i was too far with the functionlity and would have wasted too much time

i used stack overflow for reffernce to create useDate Hook to tisplay real time in the navigation

Grid layout is not perfect, but gets the job done for now.

Modal closes when clicking off the modal and when selecting a time slot.

When clicking on time slot you can see "success" message in the browser console.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
